# PyBer_Analysis
Ridesharing Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
For this project, we've been taking a close look at ridesharing datasets, and creating charts that tell a compelling story about the data. In particular, we're examining the relationship between city type (urban, suburban, rural), the number of drivers and passengers, and total fares. Our analysis and visualizations are intended to help the (fictional) company "PyBer" improve ridesharing access and affordability for underserved communities.

This exercise focuses on the last part of the project, in which we've created a summary DataFrame of the ridesharing data by city type. We've also created a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type during the first four months of 2019. Below, we'll describe the differences in the data across city types, and make recommendations to the CEO for addressing these disparities.

## Summary
For further exploration, it would be interesting to join our data city/community population figures and then generate "drivers per capita" figures to get a better feel for the ridesharing access relative to community populations. That said we can draw pretty good conclusions from
